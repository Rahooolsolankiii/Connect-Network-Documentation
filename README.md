# Connect Network Documentation

## What is Connect Network?

Connect Network is a fast, scalable, and secure blockchain platform built on HBFT (an IBFT2 consensus protocol).



**Hyperthereum** protocol allows Connect Network to be a very fast yet secure blockchain system. It brings together the best of both Hyperledger and Ethereum; as Ethereum is becoming a technology standard.

Connect Network is:

* Permissionless
* Decentralized
* Open-Source
* User Friendly

## Key Features

**Speed**

Connect Network achieves transactions finality in 5 seconds on average.

**Scalability**

Connect Network can process thousands of transactions per second and can scale to hundreds of nodes.

**Security**

Hyperthereum provides institutional-grade security to distributed networks. Connect Network offers absolute finality, which means that transactions can never be reverted like in networks with probabilistic finality. Connect Network is also leaderless. By removing leaders, security doesnâ€™t rely on a small set of actors.

**Smart contract support**

Connect Network is fully compatible with Ethereum. Developers can create and deploy smart contracts as they would on Ethereum.

**Blockchain-as-a-service**

Hyperthereum can be used to create any kind of private and public distributed ledger, using EVM or Cosmos SDK.

**Blockchain for the masses**

Connect Network is a platform for creating blockchain networks, both isolated and sidechains, with an easy-to-use user interface.
